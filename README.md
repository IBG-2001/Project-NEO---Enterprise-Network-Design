## Project Overview

Proyecto NEO is an enterprise network design project based on a multi-branch architecture.

The network consists of four branches interconnected through a WAN/cloud.  
Each branch contains six offices, and each office is composed of three main departments.

The design focuses on scalability, logical segmentation and enterprise best practices, including:
- VLAN-based segmentation per department
- Centralized DHCP per branch
- Inter-VLAN routing using Router-on-a-Stick
- Dynamic routing with OSPF
- Hierarchical IP addressing for future growth
